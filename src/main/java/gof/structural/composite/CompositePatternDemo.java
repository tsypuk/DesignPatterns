/**
 * Created by rtsy on 21.03.2016.
 * Composite pattern is used where we need to treat a group of objects in similar way as a single object.
 * Composite pattern composes objects in term of a tree structure to represent part as well as whole hierarchy.
 * This type of design pattern comes under structural pattern as this pattern creates a tree structure of group of objects.
 * This pattern creates a class that contains group of its own objects. This class provides ways to modify its group of same objects.
