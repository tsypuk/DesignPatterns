/**
 * Created by rtsy on 21.03.2016.
 * The Adapter Pattern converts the interface of a class into another interface the clients expect.
 * Adapter lets classes work together that couldnâ€™t otherwise because of incompatible interfaces.
 *
 * Adapter pattern works as a bridge between two incompatible interfaces.
 * This type of design pattern comes under structural pattern as this pattern combines the capability of two independent interfaces.
 * This pattern involves a single class which is responsible to join functionalities of independent or incompatible interfaces.
 * java.util.Arrays#asList()

 -java.io.InputStreamReader(InputStream)
